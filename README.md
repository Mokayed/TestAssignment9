# TestAssignment9

<p>What we have done here is we have made a servlet page, that has the parameters of: user, username.

In jMeter we are also sending a checker for if the extra parameter form the excel file contains true or false.

Unfortunately the response error has to do with it not being a json object, which is something we have tried to fix alot by playing with gson</p>

<p>So the Assignment is not done yet, ill informe you when it get done, so please tell me who you are so i know who i should speak with when the assgment is ready to a review</p>
